Version 4.0.5
====================================================

Release Date: Not released

**4.0.5 release of CodeIgniter4**

Enhancements:

- New URL helper function ``url_to()`` which creates absolute URLs based on controllers.

Bugs Fixed:

- Fixed a bug in ``Entity`` class where declaring class parameters was preventing data propagation to the ``attributes`` array.
- Handling for the environment variable ``encryption.key`` has changed. Previously, explicit function calls, like ``getenv('encryption.key')`` or ``env('encryption.key')`` where the value has the special prefix ``hex2bin:`` returns an automatically converted binary string. This is now changed to just return the character string with the prefix. This change was due to incompatibility with handling binary strings in environment variables on Windows platforms. However, accessing ``$key`` using ``Encryption`` class config remains unchanged and still returns a binary string.
