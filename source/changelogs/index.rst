Version 4.0.0-alpha.3
====================================================

Release Date: November 30, 2018

**Next alpha release of CodeIgniter4**

- Numerous bug fixes, across the framework
- Many missing features implemented, across the framework
- Code coverage is up to 72%
- CodeIgniter4 has been promoted to its own github organization.
  That is reflected in docs and comments.
- We have integrated a git pre-commit hook, which will apply the
  CI4 code sniffer rules, and attempt to fix them.
  We have run all the source files through it, and any "funny"
  code formatting is temporary until the rules are updated.
- We welcome Natan Felles, from Brazil, to the code developer team.
  He has proven to be passionate, dedicated and thorough :)
