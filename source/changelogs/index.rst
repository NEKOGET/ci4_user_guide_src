====================================================

Release Date: Not Released

**Next alpha release of CodeIgniter4**

- Numerous bug fixes
- Many missing features implemented
- CodeIgniter4 has been promoted to its own github organization.
That is reflected in docs and comments.
- We have integrated a git pre-commit hook, which will apply the
CI4 code sniffer rules, and attempt to fix them.
We have run all the source files through it, and any "funny"
code formatting is temporary until the rules are updated.
