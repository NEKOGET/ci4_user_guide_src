Version 4.1.5
=============

Release Date: Not released

**4.1.5 release of CodeIgniter4**

BREAKING:

Fixed `a bug <https://github.com/codeigniter4/CodeIgniter4/issues/2913>`_ on CSRF protection.
Now CSRF protection works on PUT/PATCH/DELETE requests when CSRF filter is applied.
If you use such requests, you need to send CSRF token.

Enhancements:

- Added Cache config for reserved characters
- The ``addForeignKey`` function of the ``Forge`` class can now define composite foreign keys in an array
- The ``dropKey`` function of the ``Forge`` class can remove key

Changes:

- Always escape identifiers in the ``set``, ``setUpdateBatch``, and ``insertBatch`` functions in ``BaseBuilder``.

Deprecations:

- Deprecated ``CodeIgniter\\Cache\\Handlers\\BaseHandler::RESERVED_CHARACTERS`` in favor of the new config property

Bugs Fixed:
