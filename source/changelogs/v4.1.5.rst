BREAKING
========

- Fixed `a bug <https://github.com/codeigniter4/CodeIgniter4/issues/2913>`_ on CSRF protection. Now CSRF protection works on PUT/PATCH/DELETE requests when CSRF filter is applied. If you use such requests, you need to send CSRF token.
- In the previous version, if you didn't provide your own headers, ``CURLRequest`` would send the request-headers from the browser, due to a bug. As of this version, it does not send them.

Enhancements
============

- Added Cache config for reserved characters
- The ``addForeignKey`` function of the ``Forge`` class can now define composite foreign keys in an array
- The ``dropKey`` function of the ``Forge`` class can remove key

Changes
=======

- Always escape identifiers in the ``set``, ``setUpdateBatch``, and ``insertBatch`` functions in ``BaseBuilder``.

Deprecations
============

- Deprecated ``CodeIgniter\\Cache\\Handlers\\BaseHandler::RESERVED_CHARACTERS`` in favor of the new config property

Bugs Fixed
