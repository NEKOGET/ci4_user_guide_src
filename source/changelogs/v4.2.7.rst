BREAKING
********

- The default values of the parameters in :php:func:`set_cookie()` and :php:meth:`CodeIgniter\\HTTP\\Response::setCookie()` has been fixed. Now the default values of ``$secure`` and ``$httponly`` are ``null``, and these values will be replaced with the ``Config\Cookie`` values.
-  ``Time::__toString()`` is now locale-independent. It returns database-compatible strings like '2022-09-07 12:00:00' in any locale.
- The Validation rule ``Validation\Rule::required_without()`` and ``Validation\StrictRules\Rule::required_without()`` parameters have been changed and the logic of these rule has also been fixed.
