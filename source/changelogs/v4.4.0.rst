BREAKING

Behavior Changes
================

URI::setSegment() and Non-Existent Segment
------------------------------------------

An exception is now thrown when you set the last ``+2`` segment.
In previous versions, an exception was thrown only if the last segment ``+3``
or more was specified. See :ref:`upgrade-440-uri-setsegment`.

The next segment (``+1``) of the current last segment can be set as before.

  See :ref:`Database Configuration <database-config-explanation-of-values>`.
- **SQLSRV:** Field Metadata now includes ``nullable``. See :ref:`db-metadata-getfielddata`.

Model
=====

- Added special getter/setter to Entity to avoid method name conflicts.
  See :ref:`entities-special-getter-setter`.

Libraries
=========

- **Validation:** Added ``Validation::getValidated()`` method that gets
  the actual validated data. See :ref:`validation-getting-validated-data` for details.
- **Images:** The option ``$quality`` can now be used to compress WebP images.
- **Uploaded Files:** Added ``UploadedFiles::getClientPath()`` method that returns
  the value of the `full_path` index of the file if it was uploaded via directory upload.
- **CURLRequest:** Added a request option ``proxy``. See
  :ref:`CURLRequest Class <curlrequest-request-options-proxy>`.

Helpers and Functions
=====================

- **Array:** Added :php:func:`array_group_by()` helper function to group data
  values together. Supports dot-notation syntax.
- **Common:** :php:func:`force_https()` no longer terminates the application, but throws a ``RedirectException``.

Others
======

- **DownloadResponse:** Added ``DownloadResponse::inline()`` method that sets
  the ``Content-Disposition: inline`` header to display the file in the browser.
  See :ref:`open-file-in-browser` for details.
- **View:** Added optional 2nd parameter ``$saveData`` on ``renderSection()`` to prevent from auto cleans the data after displaying. See :ref:`View Layouts <creating-a-layout>` for details.
- **Auto Routing (Improved)**: Now you can route to Modules.
  See :ref:`auto-routing-improved-module-routing` for details.
- **Auto Routing (Improved):** If a controller is found that corresponds to a URI
  segment and that controller does not have a method defined for the URI segment,
  the default method will now be executed. This addition allows for more flexible
  handling of URIs in auto routing.
  See :ref:`controller-default-method-fallback` for details.

- **RedirectException:** implements ResponsableInterface.

Message Changes
***************

- Improved ``HTTP.invalidHTTPProtocol`` error message.

Changes
*******

- **Images:** The default quality for WebP in ``GDHandler`` has been changed from 80 to 90.
- **Config:** The deprecated Cookie items in **app/Config/App.php** has been removed.
- **Config:** The deprecated Session items in **app/Config/App.php** has been removed.
- **Config:** The deprecated CSRF items in **app/Config/App.php** has been removed.
- **Config:** Routing settings have been moved to **app/Config/Routing.php** config file.
  See :ref:`Upgrading Guide <upgrade-440-config-routing>`.
- **DownloadResponse:** When generating response headers, does not replace the ``Content-Disposition`` header if it was previously specified.
- **Autoloader:** Before v4.4.0, CodeIgniter autoloader did not allow special
  characters that are illegal in filenames on certain operating systems.
  The symbols that can be used are ``/``, ``_``, ``.``, ``:``, ``\`` and space.
  So if you installed CodeIgniter under the folder that contains the special
  characters like ``(``, ``)``, etc., CodeIgniter didn't work. Since v4.4.0,
  this restriction has been removed.
- **RouteCollection:** The array structure of the protected property ``$routes``
  has been modified for performance.
- **HSTS:** Now :php:func:`force_https()` or
  ``Config\App::$forceGlobalSecureRequests = true`` sets the HTTP status code 307,
  which allows the HTTP request method to be preserved after the redirect.
  In previous versions, it was 302.
