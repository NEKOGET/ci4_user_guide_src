Message Changes

Changes
*******

- **Database Migrations:** The ``-g`` option for the ``spark migrate:rollback``
  command was removed. It did not work from the beginning. Also, the rollback
  command returns the database(s) state to a specified batch number and cannot
  specify only a specific database group.

Bugs Fixed
**********

- **Security:** Fixed a bug where the CSRF token wasn't checked if we sent it in the raw body (not JSON format) for PUT, PATCH, and DELETE requests.

See the repo's
`CHANGELOG.md <https://github.com/codeigniter4/CodeIgniter4/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md>`_
for a complete list of bugs fixed.
