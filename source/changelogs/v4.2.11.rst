Bugs Fixed
**********

- Fixed a ``FileLocator::locateFile()`` bug where a similar namespace name could be replaced by another, causing a failure to find a file that exists.
- Fixed a ``RedisHandler`` session class to use the correct config when used with a socket connection.

See the repo's `CHANGELOG.md <https://github.com/codeigniter4/CodeIgniter4/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md>`_ for a complete list of bugs fixed.
