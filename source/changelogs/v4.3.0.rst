BREAKING
********

Behavior Changes
================

.. _exceptions-when-database-errors-occur:

Exceptions when Database Errors Occur
-------------------------------------

- The exceptions thrown by the database connection classes have been changed to ``CodeIgniter\Database\Exceptions\DatabaseException``. Previously, different database drivers threw different exception classes, but these have been unified into ``DatabaseException``.
- The exceptions thrown by the ``execute()`` method of Prepared Queries have been changed to ``DatabaseException``. Previously, different database drivers might throw different exception classes or did not throw exceptions, but these have been unified into ``DatabaseException``.

Others
------

- The ``spark`` file has been changed due to a change in the processing of Spark commands.

Enhancements
************

- Added the ``StreamFilterTrait`` to make it easier to work with capturing data from STDOUT and STDERR streams. See :ref:`testing-overview-stream-filters`.
- Added before and after events to ``BaseModel::insertBatch()`` and ``BaseModel::updateBatch()`` methods. See :ref:`model-events-callbacks`.
- Added ``Model::allowEmptyInserts()`` method to insert empty data. See :ref:`Using CodeIgniter's Model <model-allow-empty-inserts>`
- Added ``$routes->useSupportedLocalesOnly(true)`` so that the Router returns 404 Not Found if the locale in the URL is not supported in ``Config\App::$supportedLocales``. See :ref:`Localization <localization-in-routes>`
- The call handler for Spark commands from the ``CodeIgniter\CodeIgniter`` class has been extracted. This will reduce the cost of console calls.

Changes
*******

- To be consistent in behavior regardless of environments, ``Config\Database::$default['DBDebug']`` and ``Config\Database::$tests['DBDebug']`` has been changed to ``true`` by default. With these settings, an exception is always thrown when a database error occurs.
- The default value of ``BaseConnection::$DBDebu`` has been changed to ``true``.
- Changed the processing of Spark commands:
    - The ``CodeIgniter\CodeIgniter`` no longer handles Spark commands.
    - The ``CodeIgniter::isSparked()`` method has been removed.
    - The ``CodeIgniter\CLI\CommandRunner`` class has been removed due to a change in Spark commands processing.
    - The system route configuration file ``system/Config/Routes.php`` has been removed.
    - The route configuration file ``app/Config/Routes.php`` has been changed. Removed include of system routes configuration file.
