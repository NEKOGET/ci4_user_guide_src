Working With Configuration Files
################################

Every application needs a way to define various settings that affect the application.
These are handled through configuration files. Configuration files simply
hold a class that contains its settings as public properties. Unlike in many other frameworks,
there is no single class that you need to use to access your settings. Instead, you simply
create an instance of the class and all your settings are there for you.

Accessing Config Files
======================

You can access config files within your classes by creating a new instance. All of the properties
are public, so you access the settings like any other property::

	$config = new Config\EmailConfig();
	
	// Access settings as class properties
	$protocol = $config->protocol;
	$mailpath = $config->mailpath;

If no namespace is provided, it will look for the files in all available namespaces that have
been defined, as well as **/application/Config/**. All of the configuration files
that ship with CodeIgniter are namespaced with ``Config``. Using this namespace in your
application will provide the best performance since it knows exactly what directory to find the
files in and doesn't have to scan several locations in the filesystem to get there.

You can locate the configuration files any place on your server by using a different namespace.
This allows you to pull configuration files on the production server to a folder that is not in
the web-accessible space at all, while keeping it under **/application** for ease of access during development.

Creating Configuration Files
============================

If you need to create a new configuration file you would create a new file at your desired location,
**/application/Config** by default. Then create the class and fill it with public properties that
represent your settings::

	<?php namespace Config;
	
	class App extends \CodeIgniter\Config\BaseConfig {
	
		public $siteName = 'My Great Site';
		public $siteEmail = 'webmaster@example.com';
		
	}

The class should extend ``\CodeIgniter\Config\BaseConfig`` to ensure that it can receive environment-specific
settings.

Handling Different Environments
===============================

Because your site can operate within multiple environments, such as the developer's local machine or
the server used for the production site, you can modify your values based on the environment.  Within these
you will have settings that might change depending on the server it's running on.This can include
database settings, API credentials, and other settings that will vary between deploys.

You can store values in a **.env** file in the **/application** directory. It is simply a collection of name/value pairs separated by an equal
sign, much like a .ini file::

	S3_BUCKET="dotenv"
	SECRET_KEY="super_secret_key"

If the variable exists in the environment already, it will NOT be overwritten. 

.. important:: Make sure the **.env** file is added to **.gitignore** (or your version control system's equivalent)
	so it is not checked-in the code. Failure to do so could result in sensitive credentials being stored in the
	repository for anyone to find.

You are encouraged to create a template file, like **env.example**, that has all of the variables your project
needs with empty or dummy data. In each environment, you can then copy the file to **.env** and fill in the
appropriate data.

When your application runs, this file will be automatically loaded and the variables will be put into
the environment. This will work in any environment except for production, where the variables should be
set in the environment through whatever means your getServer supports, such as .htaccess files, etc. These
variables are then available through ``getenv()``, ``$_SERVER``, and ``$_ENV``. Of the three, ``getenv()`` function
is recommended since it is not case-sensitive::

	$s3_bucket = getenv('S3_BUCKET');
	$s3_bucket = $_ENV['S3_BUCKET'];
	$s3_bucket = $_SERVER['S3_BUCKET'];

Nesting Variables
=================

To save on typing, you can reuse variables that you've already specified in the file by wrapping the
variable name within ``${...}``::

	BASE_DIR="/var/webroot/project-root"
	CACHE_DIR="${BASE_DIR}/cache"
	TMP_DIR="${BASE_DIR}/tmp" 


Namespaced Variables
====================

There will be times when you will have several variables of the same name. When this happens, the
system has no way of knowing what the correct value should be. You can protect against this by
"namespacing" the variables. This is done by including the name of the config file (all lower case),
followed by a period (.), and then the variable name itself. This is especially common when you
have multiple database connections.::

	// Not namespaced
	db_name = "my_db"

	// Namespaced for the 'Database' config file
	database.db_name = "my_db"
