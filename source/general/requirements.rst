  - Oracle via the *oci8* and *pdo* drivers
  - PostgreSQL via the *postgre* and *pdo* drivers
  - MS SQL via the *mssql*, *sqlsrv* (version 2005 and above only) and *pdo* drivers
  - SQLite via the *sqlite* (version 2), *sqlite3* (version 3) and *pdo* drivers
  - CUBRID via the *cubrid* and *pdo* drivers
  - Interbase/Firebird via the *ibase* and *pdo* drivers
  - ODBC via the *odbc* and *pdo* drivers (you should know that ODBC is actually an abstraction layer)
