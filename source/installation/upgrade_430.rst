Mandatory File Changes
**********************

spark
=====

The following files received significant changes and
**you must merge the updated versions** with your application:

* ``spark``

.. important:: If you do not update this file, Spark commands will not work at all after running ``composer update``.

    The upgrade procedure, for example, is as follows::

        > composer update
        > cp vendor/codeigniter4/framework/spark .

Config Files
============

If you are using the following Mock Config classes in testing, you need to update the corresponding Config files in **app/Config**:

- ``MockAppConfig`` (``Config\App``)
- ``MockCLIConfig`` (``Config\App``)
- ``MockSecurityConfig`` (``Config\Security``)

Add **types** to the properties in these Config classes. You may need to fix the property values to match the property types.

Breaking Changes
****************

- The exception classes may be changed when database errors occur. If you catch the exceptions, you must confirm that your code can catch the exceptions. See :ref:`exceptions-when-database-errors-occur` for details.

Breaking Enhancements
*********************

- Since the launch of Spark Commands was extracted from ``CodeIgniter\CodeIgniter``, there may be problems running these commands if the ``Services::codeigniter()`` service has been overridden.

Project Files
*************

Numerous files in the **project space** (root, app, public, writable) received updates. Due to
these files being outside of the **system** scope they will not be changed without your intervention.
There are some third-party CodeIgniter modules available to assist with merging changes to
the project space: `Explore on Packagist <https://packagist.org/explore/?query=codeigniter4%20updates>`_.

Content Changes
===============

The following files received significant changes (including deprecations or visual adjustments)
and it is recommended that you merge the updated versions with your application:

* ``app/Config/Routes.php``
    * Due to the fact that the approach to running Spark Commands has changed, there is no longer a need to load the internal routes of the framework.

All Changes
===========

This is a list of all files in the **project space** that received changes;
many will be simple comments or formatting that have no effect on the runtime:

* app/Config/Routes.php
* spark
