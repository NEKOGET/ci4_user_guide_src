Installation
############

CodeIgniter4 can be installed in a number of different ways: manually,
using `Composer <https://getcomposer.org>`_, or using
`Git <https://git-scm.com/>`_.
Which is right for you?

- We recommend the Composer installation because it keeps CodeIgniter up to date easily.
- If you would like the simple "download & go" install that CodeIgniter3
  is known for, choose the manual installation.

However you choose to install and run CodeIgniter4, the
`user guide <https://codeigniter4.github.io/userguide/>`_ is accessible online.

.. note:: Before using CodeIgniter 4, make sure that your server meets the
    :doc:`requirements </intro/requirements>`, in particular the PHP
    version and the PHP extensions that are needed.
    You may find that you have to uncomment the ``php.ini`` "extension"
    lines to enable "curl" and "intl", for instance.
